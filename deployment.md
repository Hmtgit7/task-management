## Frontend Deployment

### Option 1: Deploying to Vercel (Recommended for Next.js)

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is the preferred platform for deploying Next.js applications.

1. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Sign up or log in to Vercel
   - Click "New Project" and import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect your Next.js application

2. **Configure your project**
   - Select the frontend directory as the root directory (if in a monorepo)
   - Configure the build settings if necessary
   - Add environment variables from your `.env.local` file
   - Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to point to your production backend API
   - Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL` to point to your production WebSocket endpoint

3. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Vercel will build and deploy your application

### Option 2: Deploying to Netlify

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is another great option for deploying frontend applications.

1. **Create a new site**
   - Sign up or log in to Netlify
   - Click "New site from Git" and select your repository

2. **Configure build settings**
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Publish Directory: `out` (for static export) or `.next` (for server-side rendering)
   - Add environment variables from your `.env.local` file

3. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Netlify will build and deploy your application

## Setting Up a Custom Domain

### Vercel

1. Navigate to your project on Vercel
2. Click "Settings" > "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Configure your DNS settings according to Vercel's instructions

### Netlify

1. Navigate to your site on Netlify
2. Click "Domain settings"
3. Click "Add custom domain"
4. Configure your DNS settings according to Netlify's instructions

## Setting Up SSL/TLS

Most deployment platforms (Vercel, Netlify, Render, Railway) provide automatic SSL/TLS certificates. If you're using a custom domain, make sure to configure the DNS settings correctly to enable HTTPS.

## Database Setup

### MongoDB Atlas

For production, it's recommended to use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), a fully managed cloud database.

1. Create an account on MongoDB Atlas
2. Create a new cluster
3. Configure network access to allow connections from your backend
4. Create a database user
5. Get your connection string and update your backend environment variables

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Both Vercel and Netlify provide automatic deployments when you push changes to your repository. For more advanced CI/CD pipelines, consider using:

- GitHub Actions
- CircleCI
- Jenkins

## Monitoring and Logging

For production applications, consider implementing:

- Application monitoring with tools like New Relic, Datadog, or PM2
- Error tracking with Sentry
- Centralized logging with ELK Stack or Loggly

## Performance Optimization

Before deploying to production, make sure to:

1. Enable server-side caching
2. Configure proper cache headers
3. Optimize and minify static assets
4. Enable GZIP compression
5. Use a CDN for static assets

## Security Considerations

Ensure your production deployment is secure by:

1. Using HTTPS for all communications
2. Implementing rate limiting
3. Setting up proper CORS configuration
4. Using secure HTTP headers
5. Regularly updating dependencies
6. Setting up input validation and sanitization
